# Project Name

The assignment for this week was to create a Guess Who game where the computer randomly selects a secret person that the user then can ask questions about to try to find out who the secret person is. The user can also guess on a specific person during the game.

## The problem

This week I had a lot of Aha-moments when the problems I faced was solved by for example adding a EventListener. I gained a lot of basic knowledge about JavaScript. When I got stuck I googled, got help from my Elephant team and also had the chance to ask a question in my 1:1 which helped me a lot. If I had more time I would like to add a counter which shows how many times the user have guessed and a timer that shows how long the game has been in play. I would also really like to add some sound effects if I had more time to make the game even more fun.
